# CDA IGNITION 2015
Microsite for CDA Ignition 2015 event

My first and foremost task with this microsite was to get it done fast. Therefore I decided to use the Foundation framework to help build a rapid site. My other objective that I delegated to myself was to transform an older early 2000's site into a modern website.

Things that you will find with this microsite:
* Clean typography
* Simple color use (our 3 primary colors)
* One page layout
* Responsive layout
* SIMPLE, SIMPLE, SIMPLE
